    <!-- Description -->
    <p style="text-align: center">
        Researchers in the Department are focusing on Nanosciences for potential 
        applications in drug delivery using novel multifunctional nanoparticle systems 
        that combine the advantages of nanoparticles and dendrimers (Shon) and 
        biomolecule-based nanovehicles that serve as Trojan horses for targeted drug 
        delivery (Narayanaswami). Nanocomposite materials based on biopolymers are under 
        investigation for controlled drug delivery (Slowinska), and new strategies for 
        the long term operation of implantable sensors are being developed (Slowinska). 
        New nanostructured films such as nanoisland films and C60-nanoparticle hybrid 
        films are developed for plasmonic sensing and photodectors, respectively (Shon). 
        The effect of molecular structure and the electrode/molecule contact on electrical 
        properties of single molecules is also investigated (Slowinski). The Langmuir and 
        Langmuir-Blodget methods, as well as scanning electrochemical microscopy, are 
        utilized to study the properties of monolayers (Slowinski).
