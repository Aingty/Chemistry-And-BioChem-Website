    <!-- Description -->
    <p style="text-align: center">
        Environmental and health issues due to the use of the fossil fuels and water pollutants have 
        become increasingly important. Researchers in our Department are engaged in studying the 
        chemistry underlying remediation and advanced oxidative processes to clean up water (Mezyk), 
        identifying alternative sources of energy (Derakhshan), and determining the effect of 
        environmental contaminants on early embryonic neuronal development using stem cells (Acey).
