    <!-- Description -->
    <p style="text-align: center">
        Department faculty are engaged in designing, synthesizing, and characterizing 
        materials with high thermoelectric conversion efficiency, production of hydrogen 
        from water by harnessing solar energy and identifying materials displaying exotic 
        magnetic properties (Derakhshan), developing inorganic-organic hybrid solid 
        state materials for energy and environmental applications, and using ionic liquids 
        and deep eutectic solvents in materials synthesis and design (Bu). In addition, 
        research is being carried out on detection and imaging of single molecules based 
        on their electrical properties (Slowinski), studies on molecular wires and metal 
        organic frameworks with specific coordination modes, which exhibit electronic 
        communication and/or photoluminescent properties (Li), and gas phase 
        spectroscopy (Brazier).
