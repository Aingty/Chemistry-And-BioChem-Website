    <!-- Description -->
    <p style="text-align: center">
        The Department has a strong nucleus of faculty members working in these areas, 
        including mechanism-based development of new methods and reagents for the synthesis 
        of fine pharmacological organic molecules (Buonora). There is a focus on the 
        synthesis of hemes and Ligand-heme systems (Lopez) and organophosphorus-based enzyme 
        inhibitors (Nakayama) as potential drug candidates. Others use molecular recognition 
        as a design principle to develop new synthetic molecules that are compatible with 
        and capable of regulating biological function (Schramm). Efforts are also focused on 
        researching monolayer-protected nanoparticles including Au, Pd, Pt, and bimetallic 
        nanoparticles suitable for catalytic conversion of organic functional groups (Shon) and 
        preparing organometallic and transition metal compounds with catalytic properties using 
        specially designed organic ligands (Li). Current efforts are also focused on development 
        of approaches to synthesize unnatural amino acids and nucleotides derivatized for 
        incorporation in peptides and oligonucleotides via solid phase synthesis (Schwans).
