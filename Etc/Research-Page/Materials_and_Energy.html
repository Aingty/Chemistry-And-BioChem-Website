    <!-- Description -->
    <p style="text-align: left">
        Department faculty are engaged in designing, synthesizing, and characterizing materials with high thermoelectric 
        conversion efficiency, production of hydrogen from water by harnessing solar energy and identifying materials 
        displaying exotic magnetic properties (Derakhshan), developing inorganic-organic hybrid solid state materials for 
        energy and environmental applications, and using ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents in materials synthesis and 
        design (Bu). In addition, research is being carried out on detection and imaging of single molecules based on their 
        electrical properties (Slowinski), studies on molecular wires and metal organic frameworks with specific coordination 
        modes, which exhibit electronic communication and/or photoluminescent properties (Li), and gas phase spectroscopy (Brazier).
