    <!-- Description -->
    <p style="text-align: left">
       By applying and extending the rules of physical chemistry to biological systems, faculty 
       members ask questions in a wide range of biologically relevant topics. These include the 
       transport of lipids in an aqueous system (Narayanaswami, Weers), 
       protein-lipopolysaccharides interactions in innate immunity (Weers), and design of small 
       molecules that will mimic enzymes to bind ions (Marinez). Attention is also focused on 
       ligand binding to heme iron (Lopez) and structure-function relationships of the 
       iron-binding protein lactoferrin are studied to better understand its role in mammalian 
       iron metabolism (McAbee). In addition, glycosylation of nuclear proteins is being 
       explored as a mechanism for regulating gene transcription (Acey). Biochemistry and 
       physical chemistry faculty study the dynamics of biomolecular systems via massive 
       simulations using computers donated from around the world (Sorin) and probe the chemical 
       and structural basis of how enzymes achieve their enormous rate enhancement and exquisite 
       pecificity (Schwans). Scanning probe microscopy and electrochemical methods are used to 
       study the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and sequence-specific 
       DNA-binding proteins on electrical properties of single DNA molecules and 2-D DNA 
       assemblies (Slowinski).
