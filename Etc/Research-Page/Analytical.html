    <!-- Description -->
    <p style="text-align: left">
        <strong>Analytical chemistry</strong> is focused on the deployment and optimization of new methods and 
        instrumentation in chemical analysis. The broad applications of analytical chemistry include&nbsp;
        forensics, medicine, environment, science, and engineering. The main areas of focus in analytical 
        chemistry research at CSULB are: design and application of porous crystalline materials for 
        <strong>environmental and energy</strong> applications (Prof. Tian), development of novel 
        <strong>bioanalytical</strong> methodologies in drug delivery systems based on collagen and collagen 
        peptides (Prof. Slowinska), study of free radical reactions in <strong>environmental</strong> 
        <strong>remediation</strong> of contaminated water systems and nuclear waste (Prof. Mezyk), and study 
        of the mechanism of <strong>electron transfer</strong> through single molecules and molecular 
        nanostructures (Prof. Slowinski).
