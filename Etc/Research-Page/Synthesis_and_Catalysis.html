    <!-- Description -->
    <p style="text-align: left">
        The Department has a strong nucleus of faculty members working in these areas, including mechanism-based 
        development of new methods and reagents for the synthesis of fine pharmacological organic molecules (Buonora). 
        There is a focus on the synthesis of hemes and Ligand-heme systems (Lopez) and organophosphorus-based enzyme 
        inhibitors (Nakayama) as potential drug candidates. Others use molecular recognition as a design principle to 
        develop new synthetic molecules that are compatible with and capable of regulating biological function (Schramm). 
        Efforts are also focused on researching monolayer-protected nanoparticles including Au, Pd, Pt, and bimetallic 
        nanoparticles suitable for catalytic conversion of organic functional groups (Shon) and preparing organometallic 
        and transition metal compounds with catalytic properties using specially designed organic ligands (Li). Current 
        efforts are also focused on development of approaches to synthesize unnatural amino acids and nucleotides derivatized 
        for incorporation in peptides and oligonucleotides via solid phase synthesis (Schwans).
