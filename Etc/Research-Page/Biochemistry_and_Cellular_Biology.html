    <!-- Description -->
    <p style="text-align: left">
        Faculty in the biochemistry division are engaged in fundamental research aimed at understanding the structure 
        and function of biomolecules involved in various cellular processes essential to life. The main areas of 
        research pursued encompass a wide spectrum of exciting questions related to lipid transport, enzyme catalysis, 
        signal transduction, and actin remodeling. The faculty use cutting edge techniques to explore these 
        fundamental questions, which also have applications in identification of novel therapeutic targets, and 
        development of effective drugs and delivery systems.  Members of the Bhandari lab study signaling molecules 
        and mechanisms that aid in migration and survival of cancer cells.  The Grintsevich lab investigates molecular 
        mechanisms of actin regulation that are important for neuronal development and function.  Prof. Narayanaswami 
        and her students investigate theThe role and structure-function relationships of apoE and HDL in relation to 
        drug and lipid transport, cellular efflux and uptake of cholesterol in the vascular and central nervous system 
        and at the neurovascular junction under normal and oxidative stress conditions.  The Schwans Lab combines 
        organic synthesis and biochemical approaches to investigate the energetic basis of enzyme catalysis and to 
        develop selective and potent inhibitors of cholinesterases, enzymes implicated in Alzheimer's disease.  Prof. 
        Weers' Lab aims to gain insight in the structural determinants of apolipoprotein association with membranes 
        and lipoproteins, using two different models representing one-domain and two-domain apolipoproteins: insect 
        apolipophorin III and human apolipoprotein A-I.  Members of the Sorin Lab employ Monte Carlo calculations and 
        molecular dynamics simulations to study protein and nucleic acid self-assembly, the binding intreractions and 
        dynamics of butylcholinesterase-inhibitor complexes, and the sequence-structure basis of human diseases casued 
        by collagen mutations.
