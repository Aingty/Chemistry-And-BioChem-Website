        The analytical chemistry business is growing rapidly, but academia struggles to keep up in educating new 
        generations of analytical chemists. In addition, university curricula are often outdated, failing to 
        reflect the current needs of industry. Prof. Kasha Slowinska at CSULB is a part of the initiative lead by Prof. 
        Thomas Wenzel (Bates College), funded by National Science Foundation, to improve the training of students in analytical 
        chemistry and to contemporize methods of teaching analytical chemistry following a "how to think, not just how to operate 
        [instrumentation]" mindset.

        With its origins from a casual hallway conversation between Profs. Roger Acey and Kensaku Nakayama some years ago, 
        these two began a collaboration focused on examining the development of inhibitors that targeted butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) 
        at a time when researchers were largely focused on inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to treat cognitive loss among 
        patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Profs. Acey & Nakayama soon realized that simple structural modifications 
        to organophosphorus inhibitors could greatly enhance the selectivity of BChE inhibition over that of AChE. These early 
        observations encouraged their collaboration to search for more effective organophosphorus inhibitors, leading to their 
        initial collaborative publication in 2007.
