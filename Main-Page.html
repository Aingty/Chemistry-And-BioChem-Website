        The analytical chemistry business is growing rapidly, but academia struggles to keep up in educating new 
        generations of analytical chemists. In addition, university curricula are often outdated, failing to 
        reflect the current needs of industry. Prof. Kasha Slowinska at CSULB is a part of the initiative lead by Prof. 
        Thomas Wenzel (Bates College), funded by National Science Foundation, to improve the training of students in analytical 
        chemistry and to contemporize methods of teaching analytical chemistry following a "how to think, not just how to operate 
        [instrumentation]" mindset.

        With its origins from a casual hallway conversation between Profs. Roger Acey and Kensaku Nakayama some years ago, 
        these two began a collaboration focused on examining the development of inhibitors that targeted butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) 
        at a time when researchers were largely focused on inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to treat cognitive loss among 
        patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Profs. Acey & Nakayama soon realized that simple structural modifications 
        to organophosphorus inhibitors could greatly enhance the selectivity of BChE inhibition over that of AChE. These early 
        observations encouraged their collaboration to search for more effective organophosphorus inhibitors, leading to their 
        initial collaborative publication in 2007.

                    <b>Announcing the 2018 Allergan Distinguished Visiting Lecturer!</b> Professor Peidong Yang from UC Berkeley will 
                    visit campus on Weds January 31st to offer two special talks. His general lecture, "The Science and Technology of 
                    Semiconductor Nanowires", will take place at 11AM in HSCI-102. At 4PM Prof. Yang will present his technical lecture 
                    "CO2 + H2O + Sunlight = Chemical Fuels + O2" in HSCI-105. Please join us for these talks by a leader in the field of 
                    materials chemistry! <a href="http://chemistry.csulb.edu/images/ADL-flyer-2018.jpg">Click for flyer</a>

                        support her Ph.D. studies in synthetic organic chemistry beginning this fall at <b>UC Los Angeles</b>. Her proposal, "Exploration 
                        of a New Class of Supramolecular Catalysts", involves creating new molecular cages from chiral ligands and exploring their catalytic 
                        potential. <i>Way to go, Annabelle!</i>
