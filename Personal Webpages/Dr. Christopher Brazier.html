        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>
            My main research interest is the application of spectroscopic techniques to determine the 
            properties of small gas phase molecules. My current research involves the characterization 
            of small free radicals such as B2, AlC, AlB, and SiB by observing their electronic emission 
            spectra in a corona excited supersonic expansion (CESE) source. This apparatus uses a high 
            voltage power source to generate an electric discharge, or corona, in the throat of a supersonic 
            expansion through a glass nozzle. A high speed vacuum pump is used to quickly sweep away the 
            products. The discharge serves to break up the precursor molecule which is seeded in high 
            pressure helium gas flowing through the nozzle. The atoms or fragments recombine producing the 
            molecules of interest in excited electronic states. The light emitted by the excited molecules is 
            dispersed by a 1.3m spectrometer and recorded on a CCD camera detector. The behavior of the source 
            can be observed in real-time as the conditions are changed, this is important since the ideal 
            nozzle conditions are hard to maintain.
            <br /><br />
            The spectra of the electronically and vibrationally hot but rotationally cold molecules provide 
            information on the energies and bonding in many different electronic states of these molecules. 
            Much of the work involves searching through the spectra obtained for characteristic features of 
            the species of interest. In many cases higher resolution spectra are subsequently recorded using 
            the 1m Fourier transform spectrometer at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona.
