        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left">
            I have had a long-standing interest in hepatic iron metabolism, cell membranes, and endocytosis. 
            My work has focused on hepatic metabolism of the iron-binding protein lactoferrin and the lactoferrin 
            receptor on hepatocytes, the C-type rat hepatic lectin (RHL; aka, the asialoglycoprotein receptor or 
            galactosyl receptor). We have found that lactoferrin interacts with the major subunit of RHL independent 
            of lactoferrinâ€™s carbohydrates yet which requires the lectin activity of RHL. We have also found that 
            binding determinants on lactoferrin that mimic a RHL-recognized carbohydrate are present in both N- and 
            C-lobes of lactoferrin. The molecular structure recognized by RHL on lactoferrin remains to be identified. 
            We have also found that acute iron overload induces up-regulates RHL protein expression. Overload of 
            hepatocytes with Fe3+, Cu+ or Zn2+ interferes with normal recycling and ligand-binding activity of RHL.
