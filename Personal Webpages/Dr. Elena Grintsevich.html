            <h2>Grintsevich's Research Lab</h2>
            <p>
                Research in the Grintsevich Lab focuses on regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Actin is a protein 
                that plays a central role in supporting cell shape, mechanical properties, motility, cell signaling, 
                intracellular transport, and other functions. How is it possible for one protein to have so many 
                distinct cellular functions? Short answer is - actin is a team player. Actin cytoskeleton is tightly 
                regulated by >150 different accessory proteins which are expressed and localized in a tissue-specific 
                or/and developmentally-regulated manner to support various cellular functions. Some of these 
                regulatory proteins and their interactions are extensively studied but many of them are poorly 
                understood and largely uncharacterized. 
                <br/><br/>
                Our goal is to advance the understanding of how actin is regulated in neuronal cells. It is 
                recognized that many devastating neurodegenerative diseases are linked to misregulation of 
                neuronal cytoskeleton. Indeed, functionality of the neuronal sub-structures such as dendritic 
                spines and axonal growth cones is dependent on a tightly-controlled remodeling of actin cytoskeleton. 
                The focus of our research is on the regulators of actin cytoskeleton that are linked to brain 
                pathologies and development. Understanding of these regulatory interactions will create a window of 
                opportunity for intervention in neurodegenerative diseases and normal aging. 
                <br/><br/>
                We have excellent research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. Depending on the 
                specific project, research students will learn a range of the molecular biology techniques, protein 
                expression and purification, various biochemical assays, and microscopy data analysis. 
                <br/><br/>
                We're recruiting! Three (3) graduate and three (3) undergraduate research positions are open.
