            <strong>Area of research: SNAAP速 Alkylation Chemistry of Sulfonimidates</strong>
            <br /><br />
            Dr. Maricich's research involves syntheses, reactions, mechanisms, and 
            stereochemistry of SNAAP速 alkylations of various nucleophiles by sulfonimidate 
            esters. SNAAP速 [Substitution, Nucleophilic of Acids, Alcohols and Phenols] 
            refers to alkylation of alcohols by N-tert-butyl-O-ethyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonimidate 
            [1], which produced unrearranged ethyl ethers in high yields at room temperature 
            within twenty minutes, when catalyzed by the tetrafluoroboric acid dimethyl ether 
            complex. No rearrangements were observed in the ether products formed from 
            2-methyl-1-propanol, 2-butanol, 2-methyl-2-propanol, neopentyl alcohol, 3-buten-2-ol, 
            menthol, 1-phenylethanol or cinnamyl alcohol. Optically active menthol was ethylated 
            with complete retention of configuration.

            This work was published in December 2013 as a full paper in Synthesis 2013; 45(24): 
            3361-3368. DOI: 10.1055/s-0033-1339921, entitled SNAAP Sulfonimidate Alkylating Agents 
            for Acids, Alcohols and Phenols on the work of five M.S. and thirteen undergraduate 
            students at CSULB. The key reagent [ethyl N-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonimidate] 
            reported in their paper is now available as the "Maricich ethylation reagent" from 
            Aldrich Chemical Company [Catalog # L512311]. 
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Stable, crystalline N-tert-butyl-O-ethyl-4-nitrobenzene-sulfonimidate 
            [1] has been prepared in high yield by direct O-ethylation of N-tert-butyl-4-nitro-benzenesulfonamide 
            with iodoethane and silver in methylene chloride. This sulfonimidate directly ethylates 
            various acids to esters. The stronger the acid, the faster it alkylates and in higher yield. 
            It readily ethylates alcohols and phenols to ethers at room temperature in the presence of 
            HBF4 catalyst without molecular rearrangements or racemization. We have defined these 
            reactions as SNAAP速 alkylations:. The hard sulfonimidate alkylating agent is chemoselective, 
            preferrring oxygen > nitrogen > sulfur. The sulfonamide byproduct of alkylation is readily 
            recycled to the sulfonimidate. 
            <br /><br />
            Future studies will include alkylations of biomolecules like estrogen and cyclic-AMP, 
            competition between various nucleophiles, and reactions of chiral sulfonimidates with prochiral 
            phosphoric and phosphonic acids and with hemiacetals.

            Dr. Maricich is continuing in his lab as a full-time emeritus faculty doing writing and research 
            with undergraduates and research volunteers. They are studying new sulfonimidate alkylation 
            reactions, especially those with isopropyl as the alkylating group. In addition to the predominant 
            O-alkylation of phenols, some electrophilic aromatic substitution has been observed.
