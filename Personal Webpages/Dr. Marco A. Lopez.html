        <h2>Research Interests: Ligand Binding to Iron Porphyrins</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left">
            There are three groups of projects in my lab: 1) binding studies of ligands to ferrous hemes, 2) synthesis of novel ferrous hemes, 
            and 3) computational chemistry of ferrous hemes; these are described below. 1. Binding Studies of Ligands to Ferrous Hemes. We use 
            UV-vis spectophotometry to mesure rate constants and equilibrium binding constants of ligands (e.g. CO, imidazoles, dimethylsulfoxide, 
            water, methonal) to a variety of tetraphenyl iron porphyrins to characterize the ligand-heme interaction. 2. Synthesis of Novel Ferrous 
            Hemes.We are interested in creating novel ferrous hemes so as to study electronic effects on the binding of ligands to the hemes.3. 
            Computational Chemistry of Ferrous Hemes.We use a variety of computational methods to study the structure and vibrations of ferrous hemes. 
            Computational packages used include AMBER, HyperChem, and SPARTAN.
