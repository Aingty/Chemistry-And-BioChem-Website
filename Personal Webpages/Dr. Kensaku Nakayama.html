        <h3>Brief CV:</h3>
        <p>
            Ph.D., Organic Chemistry (UCLA): 1986

        <h3>Brief Description of Research Interests:</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left">
            One area of interest in our research group is the synthesis of a wide structural range of organophosphorus compounds that can 
            potentially act as selective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, a family of enzymes that hydrolyzes 
            acetylcholine. In Alzheimer patients, butyrylcholinesterase is over-expressed and thus is primarily responsible for acetylcholine 
            hydrolysis that results in the loss of cognitive function. Thus, the development of inhibitors selective for butyrylcholinesterase 
            may result in drugs that are effective in the treatment of the progression of this disease.
            <br /><br />
            Our group is also active in the development of new synthetic methods. Recently, we established that tin(II) salts can catalyze the 
            three-component reaction between an amine, aldehyde, and a phosphite to produce alpha-aminophosphonates in mild, solvent-free conditions. 
            We are currently investigating asymmetric versions of this methodology.
