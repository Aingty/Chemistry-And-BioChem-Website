                The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry is well equipped with multiuser research 
                facilities and has a wide array of personal and common instrumentation used by our faculty 
                and students for their research programs. Among other basic chemical and biochemical 
                facilities, some of the recently acquired instruments are highlighted below.
                <br /><br />
                A recent acquisition (shown at right) is an NSF-funded Microcal Auto-iTC200 Isothermal 
                Titration Calorimeter that aids in direct and highly sensitive measurements of thermodynamic 
                parameters of chemical and biomolecular interactions. Current research using this instrument 
                includes study of effects of drug binding to human serum albumin, molecular recognition of 
                anions and organoammoniums, and protein-lipid interactions.
                <br /><br />
                Another new arrival in the Department (pictured below) is the Panalytical X'pert Pro Alpha1 
                system, a state-of-the-art instrument for performing X-ray powder diffraction. Equipped with 
                an ultrafast X'Celerator detector and the High Score Plus software, it yields high resolution 
                diffraction patterns. It is also used to detect the formation of desired phases, phase 
                homogeneity, and if present, the type of side products.
