                IIRMES serves research collaborations between faculty and students from disciplines in physical, 
                natural, and social sciences. IIRMES maintains an inventory of capital equipment that permits 
                multi-scalar chemical analyses for elemental, isotopic, and molecular characterization. This 
                centralization of the instrumentation enhances their effective utilization, scheduling, and 
                maintenance in a focused environment that actively encourages shared use to beneficially increase 
                peer exchange, collegial interaction, and collaborative ventures in cross-disciplinary research, 
                training, and teaching.
