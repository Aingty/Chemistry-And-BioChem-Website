                    Dr. Maricich's research involves syntheses, reactions, mechanisms, and stereochemistry of SNAAP® 
                    alkylations of various nucleophiles by chiral sulfonimidate esters. SNAAP® refers to facile 
                    reactions occurring rapidly under mild conditions, selectively giving high yields of products, 
                    which are readily isolated in pure form. For example, SNAAP® alkylation of alcohols by 
                    N-t-Butyl-O-ethyl-p-nitrobenzenesulfonimidate produced unrearranged ethyl ethers in high yields 
                    at room temperature within twenty minutes, when catalyzed by the tetrafluoroboric acid dimethyl ether 
                    complex. No rearrangements were observed in the ether products formed from 2-methyl-1-propanol, 
                    2-butanol, 2-methyl-2-propanol, neopentyl alcohol, 3-buten-2-ol, menthol, 1-phenylethanol or 
                    cinnamyl alcohol. Optically active menthol was ethylated with complete retention of configuration.

            <br />
            <b>In Memoriam: December 13, 1928 - August 20, 2005</b>
            <br />
            Dr. Kenneth L. Marsi, former professor and chairman of the department, died 
            Saturday, Aug. 20, in Dana Point, Calif., after a prolonged battle with a brain 
            tumor. He was 76 years of age. Marsi is survived by Irene, his wife of 50 years; 
            his four children, Marianne, Scott, Brian and Teresa, and their spouses; and 
            eight grandchildren. Kenneth Larue Marsi was born on Dec. 13, 1928 and raised in 
            Los Banos. Marsi met Irene Gutschenritter of Nortonville, Kan., while in graduate 
            school at Kansas University. They were married in 1955. Marsi distinguished himself 
            as a devoted husband and father, and was an active and involved participant in the 
            Episcopal church in Long Beach and Dana Point, Calif., as well as a leader in the 
            scientific business and education communities in Long Beach. He was an avid gardener 
            and a lover of music. Dr. and Mrs. Marsi opened up their home to a number of CSULB 
            students without financial means so that they could pursue their educations. At his 
            retirement, Marsi, faculty, family and friends established the Kenneth L. Marsi 
            Scholarship at California State University, Long Beach to assist outstanding junior 
            and senior chemistry or biochemistry majors. He also established an endowment at 
            Kansas University to aid students seeking degrees in chemistry. Marsi was a graduate 
            of San Jose State University and went on to receive his Ph.D. in organic chemistry 
            from Kansas University. Most of Marsi's professional career was served as a faculty 
            member in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University, 
            Long Beach, where he was a professor of chemistry for 35 years and department chairman 
            for 21 years, until he retired in 1996. Marsi continued to teach organic chemistry in 
            the department on a part-time basis until 2002. During his professional life, Marsi 
            authored 32 research publications, coauthored a textbook, authored more than 60 book 
            reviews and presented 40 papers at scientific meetings. He was sought for the review of 
            textbooks and scientific papers prior to their publication. His expertise and advice 
            were sought by colleges and universities across the country to review chemistry departments 
            for improvement recommendations and in preparation for accreditation. As an educator and 
            advising professor, he introduced organic chemistry to over 11,000 undergraduate students, and 
            mentored and supported 16 graduate students who went on to receive master's degrees under 
            his guidance. In 1984 he was named University Outstanding Professor and statewide Trustees 
            Outstanding Professor in 1985. He received the TRW Distinguished Professor Award and was 
            twice the recipient of the College or Natural Sciences and Mathematics Mayfield Outstanding 
            Professor Award.
