        <h2>Department History:</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            The Chemistry program at CSULB began with a temporary faculty member in 1954. 
            The first permanent faculty joined what was then the department of Physical 
            Sciences and Mathematics, chaired by Prof. Robert Henderson, in 1955. The program 
            grew rapidly. By the sprIng of 1959 the first students had earned a B.S. in 
            Chemistry and the M.S. program was about to start. In 1960, the program became 
            the Department of Chemistry, chaired by Dr. Donald Simonsen.

            Department Faculty in 1961

        <p style="text-align: left">
            From the first, the department was committed to providing students with an excellent 
            education, that included the opportunity to participate in research. Although 
            research was officially not a part of the campus mission, some members of the 
            department found ways to get research programs started. Dr. John Stern set up a 
            calorimeter in makeshift facilities and many of the early students were able to 
            conduct publishable research working with him. Other faculty members undertook small 
            projects that could use the teaching laboratories at times classes were not in 
            session. Dr. Robert Henderson designed SC3 (later known as PH3) with laboratories 
            for advanced work. Once that building opened in 1962, faculty members were able to 
            give substantial numbers of students an opportunity to participate in an active 
            research program.
            <br /><br />
            Members of the department now have up-to-date research facilities in the Molecular 
            and Life Sciences Building. A replacement for PH3 is under construction, to provide 
            additional modern facilities.
            <br /><br />
            As interest grew in the rapidly expanding field of biochemistry, the department began 
            to offer an M.S. in Biochemistry in the mid-1960's.
            <br /><br />
            In the early 1970's, the department developed a B.A. in Chemistry program to allow 
            students to complete the new requirements for a teaching credential. This program 
            omitted some of the advanced courses required for the B.S., leaving room to include a 
            group of career-related courses. The B.A. program proved to be a popular choice not 
            only for teachers but also for students preparing for the health professions, forensics, 
            and other careers for which a solid foundation in chemistry is essential.
            <br /><br >
            As time went on, more and more undergraduate students became interested in specializing 
            in biochemistry. While they had the option of including a group of Biological Science 
            courses as part of the B.A. in Chemistry program, students wanted a degree specifically 
            in biochemistry. Eventually, the CSU system authorized awarding of the B.S. in Biochemistry 
            in 1986. To better reflect its actual programs, the department changed its name in 1989, to 
            the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.
            <br /><br />
            Much has changed over the years, as earlier faculty members have retired and been replaced 
            by new faculty members with new skills and new interests, but the early commitment to 
            excellence has remained a hallmark of the department. Graduates of the program find themselves 
            well prepared to enter jobs or graduate programs. Two members of the department, Dr. Kenneth 
            Marsi and Dr. Henry Po, have been recognized by the university as Outstanding Professor and 
            many others have been recognized for outstanding teaching and for distinguished research. 
            Many members of the department have provided leadership in the American Chemical Society and 
            at the university in faculty governance, and in administrative positions. Undergraduate and 
            graduate students work closely with faculty members, participating in research that is published 
            in highly-regarded journals.

                    Dr. Maricich's research involves syntheses, reactions, mechanisms, and stereochemistry of SNAAP® 
                    alkylations of various nucleophiles by chiral sulfonimidate esters. SNAAP® refers to facile 
                    reactions occurring rapidly under mild conditions, selectively giving high yields of products, 
                    which are readily isolated in pure form. For example, SNAAP® alkylation of alcohols by 
                    N-t-Butyl-O-ethyl-p-nitrobenzenesulfonimidate produced unrearranged ethyl ethers in high yields 
                    at room temperature within twenty minutes, when catalyzed by the tetrafluoroboric acid dimethyl ether 
                    complex. No rearrangements were observed in the ether products formed from 2-methyl-1-propanol, 
                    2-butanol, 2-methyl-2-propanol, neopentyl alcohol, 3-buten-2-ol, menthol, 1-phenylethanol or 
                    cinnamyl alcohol. Optically active menthol was ethylated with complete retention of configuration.

            <b>In Memoriam: December 13, 1928 - August 20, 2005</b>
            <br />
            Dr. Kenneth L. Marsi, former professor and chairman of the department, died 
            Saturday, Aug. 20, in Dana Point, Calif., after a prolonged battle with a brain 
            tumor. He was 76 years of age. Marsi is survived by Irene, his wife of 50 years; 
            his four children, Marianne, Scott, Brian and Teresa, and their spouses; and 
            eight grandchildren. Kenneth Larue Marsi was born on Dec. 13, 1928 and raised in 
            Los Banos. Marsi met Irene Gutschenritter of Nortonville, Kan., while in graduate 
            school at Kansas University. They were married in 1955. Marsi distinguished himself 
            as a devoted husband and father, and was an active and involved participant in the 
            Episcopal church in Long Beach and Dana Point, Calif., as well as a leader in the 
            scientific business and education communities in Long Beach. He was an avid gardener 
            and a lover of music. Dr. and Mrs. Marsi opened up their home to a number of CSULB 
            students without financial means so that they could pursue their educations. At his 
            retirement, Marsi, faculty, family and friends established the Kenneth L. Marsi 
            Scholarship at California State University, Long Beach to assist outstanding junior 
            and senior chemistry or biochemistry majors. He also established an endowment at 
            Kansas University to aid students seeking degrees in chemistry. Marsi was a graduate 
            of San Jose State University and went on to receive his Ph.D. in organic chemistry 
            from Kansas University. Most of Marsi's professional career was served as a faculty 
            member in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University, 
            Long Beach, where he was a professor of chemistry for 35 years and department chairman 
            for 21 years, until he retired in 1996. Marsi continued to teach organic chemistry in 
            the department on a part-time basis until 2002. During his professional life, Marsi 
            authored 32 research publications, coauthored a textbook, authored more than 60 book 
            reviews and presented 40 papers at scientific meetings. He was sought for the review of 
            textbooks and scientific papers prior to their publication. His expertise and advice 
            were sought by colleges and universities across the country to review chemistry departments 
            for improvement recommendations and in preparation for accreditation. As an educator and 
            advising professor, he introduced organic chemistry to over 11,000 undergraduate students, and 
            mentored and supported 16 graduate students who went on to receive master's degrees under 
            his guidance. In 1984 he was named University Outstanding Professor and statewide Trustees 
            Outstanding Professor in 1985. He received the TRW Distinguished Professor Award and was 
            twice the recipient of the College or Natural Sciences and Mathematics Mayfield Outstanding 
            Professor Award.
