    <h2>WELCOME!</h2>

    <h2>The Department</h2>
    <p>
        The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the California State University, Long Beach is dedicated
        to maintaining a reputation as an outstanding department on the basis of the rigorous curriculum, the
        quality of research conducted with bachelors and master-level students, and the caliber of its graduates.
        The department values teaching and research as equal and essential components of the education of our
        students and seeks to integrate research with teaching at every possible opportunity in the curriculum. Our
        22 faculty have active research programs that focuses on providing stimulating research projects for
        students in chemistry and biochemistry. Many of these programs are federally supported, resulting in
        routine high-impact peer-reviewed publication where undergraduate and MS candidates are the lead
        authors. The department is housed in two state of the art buildings with a complete range of modern
        instrumental equipment that is used directly by students in pursuit of their training. Direct hands on use not
        only provides opportunities for answering research questions - but also provides the opportunity for
        advanced training with modern instrumentation. Our graduate class is currently composed of about 30
        Biochemistry and 30 Chemistry MS candidates. 
    </p>

    <h2>The Degree</h2>
    <p>
        <p>
            Approximately half of CSULB’s MS Chemistry and Biochemistry graduates go on to Ph.D. programs. Many
            of our MS graduates go on to pursue careers in industrial settings, pursue professional degrees or start
            teaching careers. We offer a strong program with a substantial emphasis on novel research and defense of
            a thesis. The objectives of our master's programs are: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To enhance professional credentials in order to improve employability in industry or teaching.
            </li>
            <li>
                To offer students an opportunity to develop research skills and independence in the laboratory. 
            </li>
            <li>
                To provide an opportunity for those with bachelor's degrees in the life sciences to achieve 		
                competence at the master's level in biochemistry.
            </li>
            <li>
                To provide a strong background in the chemical sciences for students who are developing
                skills, confidence and qualifications to enter a Ph.D. or professional program.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Most importantly, our department highly values both advanced academic coursework for graduate
            students and novel scientific research. We have a wide array of instrumentation and facilities available to
            our graduate students, and we are proud of the diverse range of active areas of research pursued in our
            department. 
        </p>

    <h2>Prerequisites for the MS degree</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>CHEMISTRY</strong>:
        <br/>
        A bachelor's degree with a major in chemistry; or a bachelor's degree with undergraduate
        preparation in chemistry, physics and mathematics equivalent to that required for the bachelor's degree
        with a major in chemistry at this University. Typical undergraduate coursework for BA/BS degree includes:
        Organic, Physical, Inorganic, Analytical and Instrumental methods. A student deficient in any of these
        courses must complete the course(s) as a graduate student. The courses that must be taken to make up
        those deficiencies will be determined by the Graduate Adviser in consultation with the Graduate Studies
        Committee. Students with majors in other areas may be considered for admission at the discretion of the
        Graduate Adviser.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>BIOCHEMISTRY</strong>: 
        <br/>
        A bachelor's degree with a major in chemistry or one of the biological sciences. Students
        with majors in other areas may be considered for admission at the discretion of the Graduate Adviser.
        Prerequisite courses include Organic, Physical, Biochemistry, and courses in general molecular and cellular
        biology. A student deficient in any of these courses must complete the course(s) as a graduate student. 
    </p>

    <h2>Financial Support</h2>
    <p>
        Whitaker fellowships (2/year) for incoming students as well as summer research stipends can be applied
        for. $5,000.
        <br/><br/>
        GA and TA positions are available for most students in good standing, positions include grading, leading
        lab and recitation sections, working in the stockroom and running the departmental NMRs for
        undergraduate courses and research students. Full time (20hr/week) appointments provide $12k (GA) and
